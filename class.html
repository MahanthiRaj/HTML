  <b>Purusing masters in eku</b>

  <p>Hi, I'm Mahanthi. I came to the United States to pursue my master's degree and explore new opportunities.  
    It's been a big change, but I'm learning a lot and growing every day.  
    I'm really passionate about technology and excited to see where this journey takes me.  
    Iâ€™ve met people from all over the world and experienced new cultures, which has been amazing.  
    My goal is to gain solid experience here and build a successful career in my field.</p>
